# Fitness-Vision

The Fitness Vision - Real-time Fitness Assistant aims to improve the fitness and well-being of individuals by integrating machine learning and computer vision techniques to track body positions during exercise. The web app analyzes video frames captured through a camera, processes the frames and applies a machine learning model to identify exercise completion and count repetitions. The platform also has supplementary functionality such as video overlays to improve the user's exercise experience, as well as a video upload feature for users to upload videos post-exercise.
